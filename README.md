## Manuscript repository

This repository contains the scripts and key data files used for the manuscript entitled "Two community-level artificial selection experiments using propagule strategies"

The `scripts` directory contains scripts used for processing raw data, creating key intermediate files for plotting, statistics, and summarizing data. `Figure1.R` and `Figure2.R` are scripts used for plotting the main figures. Each script generates a different figure, which can be remade from the intermediate files in this repository.

The `data` directory contains two folders: `raw` for raw data and `temp` for intermediate data that are called by scripts in this repository. The data includes all the necessary files to generate the manuscript figures.

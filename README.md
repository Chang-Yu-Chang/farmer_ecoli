## Manuscript repository

This repository contains the scripts and key data files used for the manuscript entitled "Artificially selecting microbial communities using propagule strategies"

The `scripts` directory contains scripts used for processing raw data, creating key intermediate data files for plotting, statistics, and summarizing data. `Figure1.R` and `Figure2.R` are scripts used for plotting the main figures. Each script generates a different figure, which can be remade from the intermediate files in this repository.

The `data` directory contains three folders: 

- `raw`: raw data, which are OD measures for both experiments.
- `temp`: intermediate data that are called by scripts in this repository. The data includes all the necessary files to generate the manuscript figures.
- `experiment_scheme`: cartoons for experimental schemes.

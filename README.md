## Chang2020 manuscript repository

This repository contains the scripts and key data files used in the Chang2020 manuscript.

The paper is on [bioRxiv pre-print](XXX)

The `scripts` directory contains scripts used for processing raw data, creating key intermediate files for plotting, statistics, and summarizing data. `Figure1.R` and `Figure2.R` are scripts used for plotting the main figures in the text. Each script generates a difference figure, which can be remade from the intermediate files in this repository.

The `data` directory contains the raw data folder `raw` and intermediate data folder `temp` that are called by scripts in this repository. The data includes all the necessary files to generate the manuscript figures.
